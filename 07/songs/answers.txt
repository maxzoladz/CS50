I would look at the the average of each characteristic, and see if its above a
certain value, for example 50

Example Case: AVG(energy) = 80; AVG(valence) = 82; AVG(danceability) = 78

I would conclude that this persons audio aura is very positive, energetic and 
and as the danceability average is high, this person probably listens to party hits.

If the averages would be low, I would conclude the opposite.
